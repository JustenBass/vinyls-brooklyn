ðŸ“€ INTRODUCTION-

Hello, my fellow coders and viewers. The time has come after months of studies and practice to present to you my second web application. I'm excited to showcase the new skills and knowledge that I have adapted from React to create this user interaction application. Learning React took me on a rollcoaster of a ride. It's true when they say learning vanilla javascript is key to understand how React truly works. React threw many curve balls my way, but because of my knowledge of vanilla javascript I was able to over come all of the obstacles that came with it. With that said, I'd like to introduce to you my new application..."Brooklyn Vinyls".

ðŸ“€ What is Brooklyn Vinyls?

Brooklyn Vinyls is a vinyl store located in the heart of Bushwick, NY. We opened our doors Febuary 2020 in times of uncertainty. When the lock down was put in order we knew we had to think quickly and and create an online application to keep us up and running. After endless post on instagram, twitter, and other social platforms for our application, word about Brooklyn Vinyls got around. This helped us gain new customers that invested money into our viynls through our application. Because of their love and support of music, we still stand tall and our doors now remain open. We strongly believe music is an essential tool to help people get through the good times and bad times. We are very gratful we can provide such a tool to all the music lovers that support us.

ðŸ“€ What is the goal of Brooklyn Vinyls?

The initial goal of creating this application was to help us survive the lockdown of the pandemic. However, as I was creating this app I realized it's more than just about surviving. To me it became more about brining a community together. Bringing music lovers together. Music creates a strong bond between oneself and thier emotions. Why not tie that into a community where those emotions can reflect on others. It reminds us how we feel emotionally can be related to how others feel emotionally. Music teaches us how to be aware and intune not only with oneself but others as well.


ðŸ“€ The ideas behind the application.

 I wanted to create an application that was clean and simple. When you visit our web application our goal is to make sure the buyer doesn't question what to do and how to do it. Not only did I want to make a profit off of this application but I wanted to give my users an opportunity to make a profit off the application as well. That is why I came up with the tool Post-It. It's pretty simple.  A user can add the name, artist, front-cover image, back-cover image, the price of the vinyl they want to post and sell on our page. We take care of the rest for them. Once a music lover buys thier vinyl, they get a cut directley into thier bank account. Not only can they sell and make a pretty dollar with our new implemented tool, but it's an opportunity for them to track down musical treasures they've been waiting so long to own.
